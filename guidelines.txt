data guidelines for the data aggregation framework
--------------------------------------------------

- all datasets must be projected to WGS84 (EPSG4326) before entering into system


for external datasets / manual logging:

- /sciclone/aiddata10/REU/raw always contains data that has not been altered since being collected from source

- the file structure of processed data in /sciclone/aiddata10/REU/data should mirror the structure of the raw version of data whenever possible

- temporal information for datasets/files in data folder must be retrievable from the path to files and/or file names
- files must all include at least 4 digit years
- except made for temporally invariant data which is designated using a "file_mask" input of "None"

- acceptable temporal data types for DET use include 
    - temporally invariant
    - year
    - year, month
- other temporal data types which may be added to database but are NOT valid for DET use include:
    - year, month, day of month (with additional day range option)
    - year, day of year (with additional day range option)

- file names / paths should be consistent for all files in a dataset
- all files in a raster dataset must have the same bounds and resolution

- processed data must be logged before it can be used in any application (creates datapackage.json and inserts into database)


- data being input into the framework for DET use must be either monthly, yearly or temporally invariant
- datasets with resources spanning multiple years (eg: 2004-2005,2006-2007,...) must either be reduced to a single year each (eg: start year) and a notation made in the dataset description OR each resource should be added as its own dataset 
- for data with a large range and small resource year spans (eg: 1900-2000 with resource for every 2 years) we suggest reducing each resource to a single year so it can be included in a single dataset
- data with large year spans (eg: 1900-2000 with resource every 50 years) can be added as individual datasets


boundary datasets 

requirement
- every boundary file has its own dataset
- all boundary files must be uploaded individually

recommendations
- adm boundary file dataset names should be: <uppercase country ISO3>_adm<adm #> (eg: NPL_adm0)
- country groups for adm boundary datasets should be the uppercase country ISO3 (eg: NPL)
- adm0 boundary dataset for a country (group) should always exist before other adm boundary datasets are added 

notes:
- boundary datasets do not officially become a group (in the DET interface) until they have more than 1 dataset in the group (included in "other" category until then)
