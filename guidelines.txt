data guidelines for the data aggregation framework
--------------------------------------------------

for external datasets / manual logging:

- /sciclone/aiddata10/REU/raw always contains data that has not been altered since being collected from source

- the file structure of processed data in /sciclone/aiddata10/REU/data should mirror the structure of the raw version of data whenever possible

- temporal information for datasets/files in data folder must be retrievable from the path to files and/or file names
- files must all include at least 4 digit years
- acceptable temporal data types include 
    - year
    - year, month
    - year, month, day of month (with additional day range option)
    - year, day of year (with additional day range option)
- file names / paths should be consistent for all files in a dataset
- all files in a raster dataset must have the same bounds and resolution

- processed data must be logged before it can be used in any application (creates datapackage.json and inserts into database)



for internal datasets / automatic logging:
