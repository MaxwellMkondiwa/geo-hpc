data guidelines for the data aggregation framework
--------------------------------------------------

for external datasets / manual logging:

- /sciclone/aiddata10/REU/raw always contains data that has not been altered since being collected from source

- the file structure of processed data in /sciclone/aiddata10/REU/data should mirror the structure of the raw version of data whenever possible

- temporal information for datasets/files in data folder must be retrievable from the path to files and/or file names
- files must all include at least 4 digit years
- acceptable temporal data types include 
    - year
    - year, month
    - year, month, day of month (with additional day range option)
    - year, day of year (with additional day range option)
- file names / paths should be consistent for all files in a dataset
- all files in a raster dataset must have the same bounds and resolution

- processed data must be logged before it can be used in any application (creates datapackage.json and inserts into database)


boundary datasets
- every boundary file has its own dataset
- all boundary files must be uploaded individually
- adm boundary file dataset names must be: <uppercase country ISO3>_adm<adm #> (eg: NPL_adm0)
- country groups for adm boundary datasets my be the uppercase country ISO3 (eg: NPL)
- adm boundaries other than adm0 require that an adm0 boundary dataset already exists

- for non adm boundaries (dataset name does not follow adm format), group names must either be the file's own name or match an existing group



for internal datasets / automatic logging:
