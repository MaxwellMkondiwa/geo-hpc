<b><font size=12>CSV Column Name Format Information</font></b>

In addition to the original source attributes of the boundary file (e.g., from GADM) the CSV for every extract will contain a column name "asdf_id" with values for each feature that are unique (within that boundary dataset) and one or more columns containing the extract results.

The standard format for column names used for extracts results is a three part string delimited by periods (.) such as <dataset>.<temporal>.<method> where <dataset> is the name of the dataset which was extracted, <temporal> is any temporal information related to that extract (e.g., YYYY format for year - "1999" - for year, or "none" for temporally invariant data) and <method> is the extract method used to aggregate dataset values to boundary features (e.g., "mean").

Aid data extracts utilize a similar but unique format. The <temporal> section is replaced with a unique <hash> that corresponds to the filter combination used to generate that particular aid data extract. For each aid data extract you will see three columns in the CSV that have the same <dataset> and <hash> sections of the column name with the <methods> of the three being different. These three <method> values are "sum", "potential" and "reliability." Sum represents the total aid for each feature within the boundary based on the distribution of aid used when building the aid data. Potential is the maximum aid that could have been allocated to each feature regardless of the distribution of aid used. Reliability is a ratio of sum:potential representing a simplistic measure of how accurate the distribution and aggregation of aid was relative to the boundary features used during the extract process.
